Scenario
    Design a BEAUTIFUL PHP application for a banking system that allows users to check their balance, 
	deposit money, and withdraw money from their account. The application will not connect to a real 
	database but will simulate these operations using session storage to persist data temporarily.

Requirements

    Home Page: Displays options to View Balance, Deposit Money, and Withdraw Money.
    View Balance: Shows the current balance.
    Deposit Money: Allows the user to enter an amount to deposit into their account.
    Withdraw Money: Allows the user to enter an amount to withdraw. If the balance is insufficient, 
	display an error message.

Files and Their Roles
    index.php - The homepage with navigation links.
    balance.php - Displays the current balance.
    deposit.php - Handles user input for deposits and updates the balance.
    withdraw.php - Handles withdrawal requests and updates the balance after checking for sufficient funds.
